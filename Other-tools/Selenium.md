# Selenium WebDriver script for Guru99-Bank-automated-testing

### The scope of the document
* This document contain [the link to my repo](https://github.com/MalfiRG/Guru99-Bank-automated-testing/blob/master/src/test/java/Guru99BankApp.java) with **Selenium WebDriver script** that runs on **Guru99 Bank app**.
#### What does this script do?
* It uses Chrome WebDriver to access _the manager account_ (which was created manually).
* After accessing _the manager account_, it adds the new customer to the bank database.

This is a simple script that I plan to significantly expand in the future, 
in order to demonstrate the automation of several functionalities and to review the associated requirements.
