# Other tools
### About the document
Due to the specifications of the MrBuggy3 desktop app, the utilization of very popular tools such as Selenium, Postman and DevTools is limited. 
However, this does not mean that it is impossible to test the API of the desktop application or automate UI tests. 
These tools are typically used for web applications that are widely accessed via the internet.

**In this regard I decided to include in the project the implementation of the given tools**
