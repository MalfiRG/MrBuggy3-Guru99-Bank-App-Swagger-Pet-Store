# REST API requests | Swagger Pet Store |

### About the document
"This is an exemplar of a basic RESTful API request dispatched via Postman. I exported the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) library, which enables direct importation into Postman. With this capability, you can authenticate the requests autonomously and experiment with the JSON attribute values to your liking!

### Tools required
* [Postman download (Win x64 bit)](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* [Swagger Pet Store Postman collection (json format)](https://github.com/MalfiRG/Project1/blob/main/Other-tools/Swagger-Pet-Store.postman_collection.json)
* [Swagger Pet Store website](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

### The setup
1. Download Postman from the link above.
2. Dowbload Swagger Pet Store Postman collection json file.
3. Import the file to your GoPostman workspace
4. Go to Swagger Pet Store website
	1. Go to _authorize_ bookmark
	2. In the _value_ field copy and paste _special-key_
	3. Click _authorize_

Now you will have full access to sandbox REST API request library!
