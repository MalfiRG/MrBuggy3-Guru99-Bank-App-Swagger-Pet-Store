# REST API requests | Swagger Pet Store |

### About the document
"This is an exemplar of a basic RESTful API request dispatched via Postman. I exported the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) library, which enables direct importation into Postman. With this capability, you can authenticate the requests autonomously and experiment with the JSON attribute values to your liking!

### Tools required
* [Postman download (Win x64 bit)](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* [Swagger Pet Store Postman collection (json format)](https://github.com/MalfiRG/Project1/blob/main/Other-tools/Swagger-Pet-Store.postman_collection.json)
* [Swagger Pet Store website](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

### The setup
1. Download Postman from the link above.
2. Download the Swagger Pet Store Postman collection JSON file.
3. Import the file into your Postman workspace.
4. Go to the Swagger Pet Store website.
	1. Go to _authorize_ bookmark.
	2. In the _value_ field copy and paste _special-key_.
	3. Click _authorize_.

#### The final setup should look like that:
