| **Inadequate contingency planning and disaster recovery procedures**               | System downtime and data loss in case of hardware or software failures or natural disasters | High            |
| **Poor project management practices**                                              | Project delays, cost overruns, and low-quality deliverables                                 | High            |

## Product Risks

| **Product Risks**                                   | **Impact**                                                                                                     | **Probability** |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Inadequate user interface design**                | Usability issues, user frustration, errors, and reduced productivity                                           | Medium          |
| **Incomplete or incorrect functional requirements** | Development of a system that does not meet the user's needs, low user adoption and satisfaction                | High            |
| **Inadequate performance requirements**             | Slow, unresponsive, or unreliable application, user frustration and reduced productivity                       | High            |
| **Inadequate safety requirements**                  | Risk to user's health, security, or privacy, legal and regulatory issues, and reputational damage              | High            |
| **Inadequate reliability requirements**             | System failures, data loss, and reduced user confidence in the application                                     | High            |
| **Inadequate documentation and training materials** | Users not understanding how to use the application effectively, low user adoption and satisfaction             | Medium          |
| **Inadequate defect evaluation criteria**           | Incorrect or inconsistent assessment of reported defects, unfair competition, and low participant satisfaction | Medium          |
